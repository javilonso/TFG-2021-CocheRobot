# Degree Final Project - Javier Alonso Mencia [2020-2021]
## Robot for Object Detection by using Vision based on Deep Learning

A robotic vehicle has been developed with the capability to autonomously perform driving tasks, search and pick up specific objects, and return to a home base.

## Complete operation of the system explained graphically:

First, the vehicle receives the order to search for a specific object. It leaves its home base and starts the search.

Secondly, by using the object detection system based on Deep Learning, the vehicle will search and approach to an specific object.

Thirdly, when the detected object is at a close distance, it will be picked up with the designed gripper system. Finally, the robot will search for its home base to go to it and deposit the object.

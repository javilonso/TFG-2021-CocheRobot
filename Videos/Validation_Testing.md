# Tests related to the object detection system

## - V-SDO-01
**Goal**: Check the operation of the automatic system to collect images. These images are used as a training set for the object detection system.

**Result**: The following two videos can be viewed to validate the test.

## - V-SDO-02
**Goal**: Test the operation of the object detection system with an orange Lego cube used to train the system. This test verifies:
1.	The Lego cube segmentation task.
2.	The task of positioning in the image of Lego cubes based on their segmentation.

**Result**: The following video can be viewed up to minute 0:35 to validate the test.

## - V-SDO-03 y V-SDO-04
**Goal**: Test the operation of the object detection system with Lego cubes of another color (other than orange) not used during system training. This test verifies:
1.	The segmentation task with Lego cubes of a different color than the original (orange).
2.	The task of positioning in the image of Lego cubes based on their segmentation.
3.	Data Augmentation techniques applied to generalize the detection of objects in other colors. 

**Result**: The following video can be viewed between minutes 1:13 - 1:25 to validate the test.

## - V-SDO-05
**Goal**: Check if the object detection system rejects objects other than the one indicated (Lego cube), but with the same color (orange) of the object used in the system training.

**Result**: The following video can be viewed between minutes 0:56 - 1:12 to validate the test.
